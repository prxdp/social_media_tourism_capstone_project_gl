***Overview***

This repository contains code and resources for an aviation company's project aimed at targeting potential customers for their domestic and international trips using digital advertising on a social networking platform. Instead of traditional tele-calling, the company seeks to leverage digital behavior data to reach out to customers more effectively.

***Objective***

The primary goal is to develop targeted advertisement models for different login devicesâ€”specifically for laptops and mobile devices. The company aims to understand user behavior and create models that accurately predict the propensity of customers to purchase tickets. As digital advertisements on the platform are expensive, precision and accuracy in targeting the right audience are crucial.

***Approach***

The project involves the following steps:

**Data Collection**: Utilize data from the social networking platform to understand the digital and social behavior of customers.
**Data Preprocessing**: Clean, preprocess, and analyze the collected data to extract meaningful insights regarding customer behavior on different devices.
**Model Development**: Create separate models for laptop and mobile users to predict the propensity of purchasing tickets. Utilize machine learning algorithms and techniques to achieve accurate predictions.
**Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the developed models to ensure high accuracy and precision in targeting potential customers.
**Deployment**: Implement the models to enable the aviation company to digitally advertise to the targeted audience effectively.
